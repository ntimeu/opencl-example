OpenCL Example.

Simple project to demonstrate the usage of the OpenCL 1.2 C++ API in C++
programs. Simply do the following :

$ git clone https://github.com/ntimeu/opencl-example.git
$ cd opencl-example
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ ./src/example

Please note that out-of-tree build is the only one with a correct .gitignore.
In-tree build will pollute your workspace. In case of trouble, use
git clean -fxd to clean your workspace.

It has been tested on :
* ArchLinux
* Intel HD5200 Iris Pro
* Intel Beignet (for Intel GPU OpenCL support)

The page https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GPGPU gives you hints (Archlinux
only) on how to install OpenCL on your machine.
